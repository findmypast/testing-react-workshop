Node.js is an open source, cross-platform, Javascript runtime environment for server-side web applications.

It is written in C, C++ and JavaScript and runs on Linux, Mac and Windows.

It is built upon Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

# Simple Node.js server

```js
//Lets require/import the HTTP module
var http = require('http');

//Lets define a port we want to listen to
const PORT=8080; 

//We need a function which handles requests and send response
function handleRequest(request, response){
    response.end('It Works!! Path Hit: ' + request.url);
}

//Create a server
var server = http.createServer(handleRequest);

//Lets start our server
server.listen(PORT, function(){
    //Callback triggered when server is successfully listening. Hurray!
    console.log("Server listening on: http://localhost:%s", PORT);
});
```
